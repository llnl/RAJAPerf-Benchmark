This directory contains scripts to run and process data for RAJA Perf
FCR 2026 Benchmarking Activities. The scripts are:

  - run_tier1_mi300a-spx.sh
    o Run throughput study of tier 1 kernels using SPX mode on MI300A node:
      assumes 4 APUs on node, uses flux to allocate node & run w/ 4 MPI ranks
      (for additional details, please look in script file)
  - run_tier1_mi300a-cpx.sh
    o Run throughput study of tier 1 kernels using CPX mode on MI300A node:
      assumes 4 APUs on node, uses flux to allocate node & run w/ 24 MPI ranks
      (for additional details, please look in script file)
  
  - process_data.py
    o Processes data generated by the runs scripts above to generate
      throughput plots, determine saturation points, and FOM CSV files
