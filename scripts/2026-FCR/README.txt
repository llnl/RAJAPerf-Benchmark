This directory contains scripts to run and process data for RAJA Perf
FCR 2026 Benchmarking Activities. The scripts are:

  - run_tier1_mi300a.sh <spx|cpx> <tier1|tier2> 
    o Run throughput study of tier1 or tier2 kernels using SPX or CPX mode on
      MI300A node:
        - SPX mode assumes 4 APUs on node, uses flux to allocate node & run
          w/ 4 MPI ranks (1 rank per APU)
        - CPX mode assumes 4 APUs on node, uses flux to allocate node & run
          w/ 24 MPI ranks (1 rank per XCD, 6 ranks per APU)
        - For additional details, please look in script file
  
  - process_data.py
    o Processes data generated by the runs scripts above to generate
      throughput plots, determine saturation points, and FOM CSV files
