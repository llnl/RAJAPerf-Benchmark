RAJA Performance Suite Benchmarking
====================================

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rajaperf/badge/?version=develop)](https://rajaperf.readthedocs.io/en/develop/?badge=develop)

The RAJA Performance Suite is a companion project to the [RAJA] C++ performance
portability abstraction library. The Performance Suite designed to explore
performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications.
Specifically, it is used to assess and monitor runtime performance of kernels 
implemented using [RAJA] compare those to variants implemented using common 
parallel programming models, such as OpenMP and CUDA, directly.

This project is used to maintain scripts and data associated with RAJA
Performance Suite benchmarking activities.
